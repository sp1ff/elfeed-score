	This commit some additional, new scoring features for score file version 2:
	    1. tag-specific rules: any rule can now be made to apply only when

	       - any of one or more tags are present in the entry being scored

	       - none of one or more tags are present in the entry being scored

	    2. whole-word matching: in addition to string & regex matching, rules
	       can be matched using whole-word regex matching

	Score file version 2.
	This commit does the following:

	    1. re-implements the scoring rules in terms of structs (instead)
	       of property lists

	    2. re-wrote the score file parsing logic to separate the file
	       I/O from the parsing of the score sexp.

	    3. bumps the score file format version to 2

	       - adds a new rule type "title-or-content"

	       - permits the version element of the sexp to be keyed either
	         string or symbol

	NB. Whenever the score file is written out, it will be in version
	2 format.

	Add the option to display entry scores in *elfeed-search*.
	This commit:

	    1. provides a new function, `elfeed-score-print-entry', which
	       can be used as the value of `elfeed-search-print-entry-function`;
	       when this is done, the entry score will be printed in the
	       first column of the search buffer

	    2. the format of the score is determined by a new customization
	       variable `elfeed-score-score-format'

	Note that the print function will not be substituted when
	`elfeed-score-enable` is invoked; you must do this explicitly in
	your configuration if you want this feature. However,
	`elfeed-score-unload` will remove it, if found.

	Minor textual changes:
	    1. Updated README to reflect the fact that this package has been accepted into MELPA

	    2. Updated copyright statements in source

	Preparation for submission to MELPA.
	This commit prepares `elfeed-score' for submission to MELPA:

	    1. The naming scheme for public symbols changed from "elfeed-score/"
	       to "elfeed-score-" (in accordance with the Emacs Lisp Coding
	       Conventions. Aliases are defined for all 0.1 symbols.

	    2. Docstrings are now `checkdoc'-compliant.

	    3. Loading the package no longer affects Elfeed; the package
	       must be enabled via a call to `elfeed-score-enable', and may
	       be unloaded via `elfeed-score-unload' (again in accordance
	       with the Emacs Lisp Coding Conventions).

	    4. Miscellaneous other udpates (addition of a Package-Requires
	       header & and autoload, e.g.)
