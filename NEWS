** Changes to elfeed-score 0.8.2

*** New Features

**** Added `elfeed-score-serde-add-rule'
** Changes to elfeed-score 0.8.1

*** Bugfixes

**** `elfeed-score-score` & `elfeed-score-serarch` no longer write stats too many times

* elfeed-score 0.7

** Changes to elfeed-score 0.7.10

*** Bugfixes

**** Rule statistics are now stored separately-- Issue #13

Rule statistics (# hits, last match date) have been moved out of the rule structs and stored separately.  From now on, `elfeed-score' will only *read* the score file. This should eliminate the recurring "Hey where did my rule changes go?" questions.

The stats will still be maintained, but will be written to a separate file ('elfeed.stats' by default).
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.9

*** Bugfixes

**** Make `score' mandatory in `elfeed-score-set-score' not optional
**** Address issue 10

When setting scores "manually" via `elfeed-score-set-score' will "stick": subsequently scoring that entry through the new entry hook or as part of scoring an entire search will not overwrite the manuall-set score.

Since this is a new feature, I've put it behind a configuration option `elfeed-score-scoring-manual-is-sticky' which defaults to true, but if the user dislikes this they can set it to nil to disable the feature.
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.8

*** Bugfixes

**** Address issue 12

'link' rules were not being read in correctly--fixed.
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.7

*** New Features

**** When reading an older score file, immediately re-write in the most recent format
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.6

No user-visible changes in this build; strictly re-factoring.
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.5

*** Bugfixes

**** Address issue 12

Announce the fact when making a backup copy of the score file. If there is an error on copy, say so & continue (i.e. don't error out).

*** New Features

**** New rule type: link
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.4

*** Other Changes

**** Below changes on the 0.7 branch now available on master
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.3

*** New Features

**** Write backup file on score file format version change

If elfeed-score detects that the score file it has read is in a format
prior to the current, it will write a backup file named SCORE-FILE.~N~
where SCORE-FILE is the original score file name and N is the prior
version.
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.2

*** New Features

**** Scoring Rules Now Serialized to Property Lists

This build introduces score file format version 6.

elfeed-score will now serialize scoring rules as property lists, rather than flat lists. It will, of course, continue to read all prior versions of the score file format.

Moving to property lists for the rule format, while more prolix, will reduce errors on the part of rule authors & enable better validation & error messages on the part of the package.

*** Other Changes

**** elfeed-score now requires Emacs 26.1
**** Internal changes cleaning-up after the re-factor.
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.1

*** Toher Changes

**** elfeed-score documentation re-worked

This build re-works the elfeed-score documentation, breaking
up the README:

  - introductory information & installation instructions remain
    in the README
  - user documentation has been moved to a Texinfo manual
  - developer documentation has been moved to the project Wiki
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.7.0

*** Other Changes

**** elfeed-score.el re-factored

Heretofore, `elfeed-score' was a single-file package. As the
file has grown to over 2K lines, it became increasingly
difficult to read & reason about. Beginning with the 0.7
series, I've broken it up into several smaller, hopefully
more manageable files.

Numerous functions & variables were renamed to begin with their new package prefix. In the case of public symbols, aliases were introduced so code using the old names will receive a warning about using anobsolete variable or function. However, private symbols were simply renamed-- if you wrote code accessing private symbols, this change will break your code.

**** Rules now record hit counts

Each rule will keep track of how many times it has matched; good for figuring out which rules are useful.
*** Bug Fixes

***** `elfeed-score--parse-authors-rule-sexps' was deserializing incorrectly

The date field was not being deserialized-- fixed.
***** Spelling errors

Numerous spelling errors corrected thanks to `flyspell'.
** Changes in elfeed-score 0.5.1

    2. adjust-tags: after the scoring process is complete, add or remove tags based on the score being above or below given thresholds.

**** much-improved logging

modeled on that of `elfeed' itself.

* elfeed-score 0.3

** New Features

*** scoping rules by tag

You can now scope rules by entry tags; rules can be setup to run only on entries that have one or more tags, or that have none of a given set of tags. See the README for syntax details.

*** whole-word matching

Specying a match type of 'w or 'W will perform case-insensitive or case-sensitive (resp.) whole-word regexp matching.

*** title-or-content rules

A new type of scoring rule is introduced: `title-or-content'. Such a rule performs a text match against both the title & content for each entry while allowing two different values to be added to entry's core for each sort of match.

*** Displaying Entry Scores in the Search Buffer

`elfeed-score' now provides an `elfeed-search-print-entry-function' compliant function that will display each entry's score in the first column of the search view. The score format can be controlled by the customization variable `elfeed-score-score-format'.  See the README for instructions.

* elfeed-score 0.2

** New Features

Loading the package no longer affects Elfeed; the package must be enabled via a call to `elfeed-score-enable', and may be unloaded via `elfeed-score-unload' (in accordance with the Emacs Lisp Coding Conventions).

The naming scheme for public symbols changed from "elfeed-score/" to "elfeed-score-" (in accordance with the Emacs Lisp Coding Conventions. Aliases are defined for all 0.1 symbols.
