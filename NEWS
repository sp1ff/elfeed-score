* Changes in elfeed-score 0.3.0

** New Features

*** scoping rules by tag

You can now scope rules by entry tags; rules can be setup to run only on entries that have one or more tags, or that have none of a given set of tags. See the README for syntax details.

*** whole-word matching

Specying a match type of 'w or 'W will perform case-insensitive or case-sensitive (resp.) whole-word regexp matching.

*** title-or-content rules

A new type of scoring rule is introduced: `title-or-content'. Such a rule performs a text match against both the title & content for each entry while allowing two different values to be added to entry's core for each sort of match.

*** Displaying Entry Scores in the Search Buffer

`elfeed-score' now provides an `elfeed-search-print-entry-function'
compliant function that will display each entry's score in the first
column of the search view. The score format can be controlled by
the customization variable `elfeed-score-score-format'.  See the
README for instructions.
